This is a list of stuff I want to do. If you see something here and it
seems neat, feel free to work on it. If you're worried I might be in the
middle of something I'm probably not. :) If you want to make sure before
you start working just drop me an email.

! Replace print statements with proper logging (Prevent the admin from seeing why a user was rejected)
* Style the web app so it's not a plain looking HTML form
* Have the web frontend sms the admin if it can't contact the backend
! If the user has a .phonenumber but no .ssh/authorized_keys it prompts them to enter a code but doesn't send one.
! It's possible to find valid users. All usernames should result in the "code" page but vaild users should get SMS error messages
