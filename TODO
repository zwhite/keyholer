This is a list of stuff I want to do. If you see something here and it
seems neat, feel free to work on it. If you're worried I might be in the
middle of something I'm probably not. :) If you want to make sure before
you start working just drop me an email.

* Replace print statements with proper logging
* Use argparse in keyholerd so we don't have to have a config file
* Have an option to write a config file based on argparse flags
